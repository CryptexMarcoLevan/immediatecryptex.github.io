In exercising your right to data portability, you have the right to have the Personal Data about you transmitted directly from us to another entity, where technically feasible. The exercise of your right to data portability is without prejudice to your and our rights under your right to erasure. In addition, the right to data portability shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

8.6. Right to Object
You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of Personal Data about you which is based on the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party (including our Partners), including profiling based on such legitimate interests; in such case, we shall no longer process the Personal Data about you unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

You have the right to object, at any time, to the processing of Personal Data about you for direct marketing purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

8.7. Right to Withdraw Consent
You may withdraw your consent provided to us for the purpose of processing Personal Data about you at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal. Please note that in a case where you will withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with some of our Services.
